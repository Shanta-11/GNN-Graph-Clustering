# GNN Graph clustering
This project focuses on applying unsupervised graph clustering techniques on a large dataset to analyze noisy data using DeepWalk and GraphSAGE algorithms. The dataset used in this project contains noisy data, and various dimensionality reduction methods like ISOMAP, LLE, and t-SNE were employed to preprocess the data before clustering.
